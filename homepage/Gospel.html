    <marquee direction="down" height="800" width="1600" bgcolor=#bd1354>“There’s no safety in times like this kid. I wouldn’t recommend walking the whole way.” The voice of a stranger echoes through the dimly lit tunnel. I didn’t want to stop moving, but strangers are strange. It’s better I pay attention. Taking my eyes off of the narrow path, I quietly look towards the man in the calm water beside me.
	“Not the talkative type, eh? Well no matter, I know you can hear me.” The stranger sat in a small rowboat. The near total darkness strained my eyes as I tried to get a good look at him. He was shrouded in a black coat, only visible through the raindrops that clung to him. Just like mine, his eyes too were hidden from sight. The boat he sat on was just barely big enough for two. I turn fully towards him and steadily walk to the edge of the cramped walkway.
	“If it isn’t safe then why should I trust you?”
	“Hmph, clever. Well if I try to attack you, I’m sure we’d both fall into the river. Not much I could do to get back up” he pointed to where his right leg would be. Grabbing his cane he rose to his feet.
	“It’s good to be distrusting, but be realistic. The longer you’re out here the more dangerous it becomes. There’s only one way out of this tunnel, so it’s not like I could take you anywhere you weren’t already headed.” He extends his hand to me. The cloak falling away to reveal rough and damaged skin. 
	“Please, I insist.” 
	Letting out a quiet sigh, I accepted his offer. The shifts of water ripple from the boat across the stream. Flickering penumbra pierce the small cracks along the tunnel. </marquee>
